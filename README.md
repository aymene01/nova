# Nova - Autonomous Robot Simulation System

Nova is a sophisticated robot simulation system written in Rust that models autonomous robots with specialized behaviors operating in a dynamic environment. The system features three distinct robot types, each with unique capabilities and decision-making processes, supported by an advanced A* pathfinding algorithm.

## ü§ñ Robot Types and Behaviors

### Explorer Robot üó∫Ô∏è
**Primary Mission**: Mapping and area discovery

**Characteristics:**
- **Energy Consumption**: 2 energy units per action (most efficient)
- **Energy Threshold**: Returns to station when energy drops below 20
- **Preferred Resources**: None (exploration-focused)
- **Specialization**: Systematic exploration and mapping

**Behavior Pattern:**
- **Low Energy/Carrying Resources**: Returns to station immediately
- **Primary Action**: Seeks unexplored areas within a 5-unit radius
- **Fallback Action**: Uses deterministic random exploration based on robot state
- **Exploration Strategy**: Systematic area discovery with 3-unit radius exploration tasks

**Decision Logic:**
```rust
Priority 9: Return to station (energy < 20 OR carrying resources)
Priority 7: Explore unexplored areas (radius 3)
Priority 5: Random exploration target (radius 2)
```

### Harvester Robot ‚õèÔ∏è
**Primary Mission**: Resource collection and extraction

**Characteristics:**
- **Energy Consumption**: 3 energy units per action
- **Energy Threshold**: Returns to station when energy drops below 15
- **Preferred Resources**: Energy and Mineral resources
- **Specialization**: Efficient resource gathering

**Behavior Pattern:**
- **Low Energy/Carrying Resources**: Returns to station immediately
- **Primary Action**: Searches for Energy or Mineral resources within 4-unit radius
- **Resource Prioritization**: Targets preferred resources (Energy/Mineral) over others
- **Fallback Action**: Explores for new resource locations when none are nearby

**Decision Logic:**
```rust
Priority 10: Return to station (energy < 15 OR carrying resources)
Priority 8:  Harvest preferred resources (Energy/Mineral)
Priority 6:  Explore for new resource locations
```

### Scientist Robot üî¨
**Primary Mission**: Scientific research and analysis

**Characteristics:**
- **Energy Consumption**: 4 energy units per action (most energy-intensive)
- **Energy Threshold**: Returns to station when energy drops below 25 (highest threshold)
- **Preferred Resources**: Scientific Interest points
- **Specialization**: Scientific analysis and research

**Behavior Pattern:**
- **Low Energy/Carrying Data**: Returns to station immediately
- **Primary Action**: Searches for Scientific Interest points within 6-unit radius
- **Analysis Strategy**: Determines analysis type based on terrain and resource density

**Decision Logic:**
```rust
Priority 9: Return to station (energy < 25 OR carrying data)
Priority 8: Analyze scientific interests (Chemical analysis)
Priority 6: Systematic scientific exploration
```

**Analysis Type Determination:**
- Considers terrain value and nearby resource density
- Enhanced logic for future expansion to Geological, Biological analysis types
- Currently optimized for Chemical analysis based on resource concentration

## üó∫Ô∏è Pathfinding System

### A* Algorithm Implementation
The pathfinding system uses the A* algorithm for optimal path calculation with the following features:

**Core Components:**
- **Heuristic Function**: Manhattan distance for efficient path estimation
- **Cost Calculation**: Uniform cost (1) for adjacent moves, ‚àö2 for diagonal moves
- **Obstacle Avoidance**: Dynamic terrain analysis and obstacle detection
- **Boundary Checking**: Ensures paths stay within map bounds

**Performance Optimizations:**
- **Early Termination**: Stops when target is reached
- **Efficient Data Structures**: Binary heap for open set management
- **Memory Optimization**: Reuses path nodes when possible
- **Bounded Search**: Prevents infinite loops with reasonable search limits

**Path Features:**
- **8-Directional Movement**: Supports cardinal and diagonal directions
- **Optimal Pathfinding**: Guarantees shortest path when one exists
- **Dynamic Updates**: Recalculates paths when obstacles change
- **Smooth Navigation**: Provides step-by-step movement directions

### Movement Directions
```rust
pub enum Direction {
    North, South, East, West,           // Cardinal directions
    NorthEast, NorthWest,               // Diagonal directions  
    SouthEast, SouthWest
}
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Shared Utilities

### SearchUtils Module
Common search patterns used by all robot types:

- **`radius_search`**: Configurable radius-based position searching
- **`find_nearest_resource`**: Locates closest resources of specified types
- **`find_nearest_unexplored`**: Identifies unexplored areas for mapping
- **`find_nearest_scientific_interest`**: Finds scientific points of interest

**Benefits:**
- Eliminates code duplication across robot behaviors
- Consistent search algorithms for all robot types
- Optimized performance with shared implementations
- Easy maintenance and feature updates

## üéØ Robot Comparison

| Feature | Explorer | Harvester | Scientist |
|---------|----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Energy Cost** | 2/action | 3/action | 4/action |
| **Energy Threshold** | 20 | 15 | 25 |
| **Primary Focus** | Exploration | Resource Collection | Scientific Analysis |
| **Preferred Resources** | None | Energy, Mineral | Scientific Interest |
| **Search Radius** | 5 units | 4 units | 6 units |
| **Specialization** | Mapping | Harvesting | Research |
| **Backup Behavior** | Random Exploration | Resource Exploration | Systematic Exploration |

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Decision-Making Framework
All robots follow a priority-based decision system:

1. **Energy Management**: Monitor energy levels and return to station when needed
2. **Resource Status**: Handle carrying capacity and resource delivery
3. **Specialized Tasks**: Execute type-specific primary missions
4. **Fallback Behavior**: Explore when primary objectives are unavailable

### Energy Management
- **Dynamic Thresholds**: Each robot type has optimized energy thresholds
- **Efficient Routing**: Pathfinding minimizes energy consumption
- **Strategic Planning**: Robots plan return trips based on remaining energy
- **Resource Optimization**: Balanced energy costs vs. capability benefits
